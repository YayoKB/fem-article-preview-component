## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to make a tooltip effect in CSS
- I learned about using `mask` to change the color of an SVG. As I didn't know much about using SVGs and changing their colour, I googled ways in which to do so. I ended up placing a div inside another div, so that I could both change the background colour of the parent div and then the colour of the child div/icon.
- I learned more about using JavaScript and event handlers.

### Continued development

- The Javascript really got to me here combined with the cascading effects of CSS in addition to media queries. I struggled a bit with these and therefore I would like to do some more practice with this, especially media queries in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [How To Make Tooltips With Only CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujlpzTyJp-M) - This was my first time making a tooltip, so I had to look for guidance. This video helped me a lot.
